# Monte Carlo Race Simulation

High-performance Monte Carlo simulation of car races with advanced strategies.

## Features
- Tyre degradation and performance drop-off
- Push laps with speed boost and crash risk
- Flexible pit stop scheduling
- Python and R implementations

## Python Usage

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # or env\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python montecarlo_race_simulation.py
```

Results saved to `race.csv`.

## R Usage

You can also run the R script directly in RStudio by opening `race.R` and clicking **Run**.

## Customization
Edit `cars` and `track` objects in the scripts to modify strategies and race conditions.
